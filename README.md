# EP1-Alternative-Enclosure
An alternative enclosure for the everything presence one sensor

I wanted to design an enclosure for the EP1 that fully enclosed the mmwave sensor so that no spiders etc. got inside and created false alarms, this means a compromise to the light and temperature sensors but I've tried to allow for these as best I can whilst keeping the case basically spider proof.
# Some Features
* I used a 180 degree USBC adapter to convert the cable entry from downwards to upwards
* Air flow path for temp sensor
* light tube to allow light to fall on the sensor
* fully adjustable mount
* Enclosure secured with M3 countersunk screws
